                            Customer expectations for banks, wealth management companies and
                            insurers are on the rise. In 2013, more than half of consumer
                            bank interactions around the world took place through online or
                            mobile channels, according to Bain & Company customer surveys.
                            Include ATMs and the share of electronic, digital interactions
                            exceeds 85% today and could hit 95% by 2020. Technology is at
                            the heart of this transformation, and with the right
                            capabilities financial firms can compete against nimble,
                            technologically sophisticated start-ups that are reimagining
                            ways to serve customers’ financial needs. Executives see the
                            opportunity to deliver differentiated customer experiences and
                            “wow” moments - like the ability to deposit checks with a mobile
                            phone camera, remote bill pay or even basic transactions
                            delivered through a good mobile app. And this trend accelerates
                            for younger customers: 39% of those over the age of 45
                            considered the quality of a mobile app when switching banks, but
                            58% of those younger than 45 took it into account. However, in
                            most financial institutions, significant gaps exist between the
                            business’s aspirations and what they can realistically
                            accomplish. Executives demand greater speed and agility, but
                            their IT departments are unable to deliver, resulting in
                            frustrations and mutual distrust. The C-suite demands for
                            faster, cheaper, better grow louder as the IT function has
                            become slow, expensive and, in some extreme instances,
                            paralyzed. Many factors contribute to this immobilization,
                            including rapidly increasing volumes of business and regulatory
                            demands, a growing need to support complex business processes
                            and products, inflexible legacy systems architectures, onerous
                            internal processes and talent limitations. We believe this
                            problem is larger than IT; it is a strategic business challenge
                            as well as a great opportunity. Technology executives now have a
                            platform and an environment in which company leadership is keen
                            to listen and support IT initiatives. Business executives will
                            need to work with IT more closely than ever before, supporting
                            technology recommendations and gaining a clear understanding of
                            the challenges and opportunities that technology affords.
                            Working together, they can move quickly to bring their banks,
                            insurance companies and other financial institutions forward
                            into the rapidly evolving digital age.

                            A new digital IT operating model
                        </h6>
                        In our view, the frustrations expressed by business and IT executives are largely due to a
                        mismatch between the business’s expectations about how to
                        consistently and rapidly deliver superior digital customer experiences and IT’s inability to
                        fulfill these expectations. Financial institutions did not design
                        their current IT operating models to deliver daily functionality updates or allow change to be
                        an ongoing theme in development. The current model was
                        designed to deliver stability, predictability, risk mitigation and efficiency - and most banks
                        have delivered on those design principles.
                        From our work with banks, insurers and wealth management companies facing this challenge, we
                        find that many need to “reboot” their technology
                        organizations. The transformation required - to the business, technology and organizational
                        culture - is so great that it demands leaders challenge
                        traditional assumptions about the ways IT and the business work together. As executives move
                        through this critical transformation toward their goal of
                        becoming digital leaders, an interesting thing happens: They begin to think, hire, collaborate
                        and operate more like technology companies.
                        What does this transformation aim to achieve? Some say it’s all about enabling speed. While
                        speed is critical, we think that oversimplifies the challenge.
                        As guardians of customers’ financial security, financial services companies must maintain client
                        trust in their brands, which is the foundation of their
                        customer relationship. Toward that end, IT leaders must worry about cybersecurity capabilities
                        to counter increasingly sophisticated threats. They must
                        be able to provide anytime-anywhere access while continuing to meet regulatory demands. They
                        have to do all of this and construct a scalable and
                        intelligent environment that delivers on mobile, Web, social and advanced analytic
                        considerations. IT leaders aren’t getting a free pass on these other
                        priorities.
